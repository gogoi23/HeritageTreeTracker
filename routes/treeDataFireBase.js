Oak savannah was the dominant habitat of the Willamette Valley, and it is possible that this white oak is a remnant of the balanced management practices carried out by indigenous Chinookan people on a large scale across the Willamette Valley. Controlled burns were used to maintain oak savannah for promoting growth of food staples such as camas, berries, and acorns and minimizing competition of conifers and shrubs that would compete with Oregon white oaks. Fires shocked oaks into producing mast crops of acorns, which would be preserved and used for food and trade. Today, this oak is adjacent to the sidewalk in NW Portland along a busy thoroughfare lined with shops and restaurants, still thriving in the city grew around it.",
