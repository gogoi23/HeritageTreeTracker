<h2>FUN FACTS</h2>
<h3>London Plantree</h3>
<p>
    The London Planetree [on NW/C SW PARK & SW MAIN ST] was planted by Sylvester
    Farrell in the planting strip in front of his house,
    as determined by historic photos of the home that
    show the newly planted tree. This tree has seen
    its surroundings change several times over the
    course of its life. Today, the lot is being used as a
    parking lot. London planetrees are notable for
    : their resilience to the stressors of the urban
    environment and their longevity. This heritage
    tree may well see the land around it continue to
    change as the city continues to grow and
    develop.
</p> <br>

<h3>Beech Tree</h3>
<p>
    The beech tree [on 10115 NE THOMPSON ST] was brought to its current location as a
    seedling all the way from Missouri in the early 20th century
    and planted by a Mrs. Moore in what is now the Parkrose
    Heights neighborhood of Portland. Neighbors petitioned
    Multnomah County to remove the tree in 1977, but their
    request was denied. Parkrose Heights was an affluent
    municipality outside of Portland proper until it was annexed
    by the City in 1983. Annexation brought about changes in
    land-use from farms to apartment blocks and higher taxes.
    Parkrose Heights is one of the most diverse neighborhoods
    in Portland as a result of having a high population of
    immigrants and those displaced by the gentrification of
    close-in neighborhoods.
</p> <br>

<h3>White Oak</h3>
<p>
    The germination of this heritage Oregon white oak [on 1310-1338 NW 23RD AVE] is thought to
    predate the establishment of Portland as a city by white settlers in
    1843. Oak savannah was the dominant habitat of the Willamette
    Valley, and it is possible that this white oak is a remnant of the
    balanced management practices carried out by indigenous
    Chinookan people on a large scale across the Willamette Valley.
    Controlled burns were used to maintain oak savannah for
    promoting growth of food staples such as camas, berries, and
    acorns and minimizing competition of conifers and shrubs that
    would compete with Oregon white oaks. Fires shocked oaks into
    producing mast crops of acorns, which would be preserved and
    used for food and trade. Today, this oak is adjacent to the
    sidewalk in NW Portland along a busy thoroughfare lined with
    shops and restaurants, still thriving in the city grew around it.
</p> <br>

<h3>American (Burrell) Elm</h3>
<p>
    The Burrell Elm [1111 SW 10th AVE] is the second historic tree
    recognized by the City of Portland. It is an
    American Elm tree that was planted in 1870 at
    the home of Martin and Rosetta Burrell, in what
    was their private garden at the time. As Portland
    grew, the character of the neighborhood
    changed from private single-family homes to
    denser development. This elm tree is now
    behind the sidewalk in front of the YWCA in
    downtown Portland.
</p> <br>

<h3>Tulip Tree</h3>
<p>
    George Nicolai built a house on this lot for his
    new wife and planted the tulip tree [on 1403 NE WEIDLER ST] after
    construction was completed, in the late 1880s.
    The use of this lot has changed over the
    decades since the tree was planted, resulting in
    some construction damage to the roots.
    However, this tree thrives along busy NE 15th
    Ave.
